Task: Time Difference Calculator

This document outlines the programming challenge for developing a Time Difference Calculator.

Objective:
The goal is to create a program that calculates the time difference between various locations around the world. This tool will be useful for individuals who frequently navigate different time zones, such as travellers, coordinators, or anyone working with geographically dispersed teams.

Functionality:
User Input: The program should provide a user-friendly method for entering a list of locations (cities or regions) for which they want to calculate the time difference. This could be achieved through text input, selection from a pre-populated list, or any other intuitive method you choose.
Time Zone Management: The program must automatically determine the corresponding time zones for each entered location.
Time Difference Calculation: The core functionality involves calculating the time difference between each entered location and a designated reference time. The resulting difference should be displayed in a clear and concise format.
